kvstore: a DPDK/mTCP enabled kvstore application
   Single-Process, Multi-threaded Usage:
      ./kvstore -f kvstore.conf [-N #cores] 

options:
  -N: number of CPU cores to use. default: all existing cores
  -f: path to mtcp configuration file

Based on an example epserver application written by the mTCP developers.
Utilizes DPDK 16.04 and mTCP. Uses libcuckoo to provide the data structure
for the KV store itself (stored in shared memory).

Note: This won't make without changes to Makefile, the references to the 
mTCP library and DPDK are both wrong.
